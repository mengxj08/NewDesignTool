# Experimental Design Tool
This is a early prototype of NexP. You might realize that there are many trials of verisons of NexP in my repositories. Well, that's the part of PhD life. You keep going through the trail-and-error process during the whole PhD... Please check the final version of [NexP](https://github.com/mengxj08/webnexp) anyway.
